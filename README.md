# Python-Work

Documenting exercises I've done in Python. All text exercises meant to be run in the terminal using VS Code or any other preffered text editor, graphical code blocks ran in IDLE.

## How To Use
If downloading to a local repo, make sure that the latest version of Python is installed on your machine. See [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for one of many installation guides that can help you.

## Simple Code Blocks
Short blocks of code that accomplish singular goals for the purpose of learning different aspects of Python. These are all very elementary, but work is work and should be documented.


### Car

Draws the equivalent of a child's drawing of a car on a canvas window using the `turtle` graphics module.

### Guessing Game

A simple guessing game that randomly generates an integer between 1 and 100 and has the user guess until they give the correct answer. It also gives hints on whether to subsequently guess higher or lower.

### Image Display

Displays an image on a user's computer by following the input directory, and opening a canvas window of the specified height and width using the `tkinter` GUI.

### Moving Triangle
A short animation of a black triangle moving across the canvas using the `tkinter` GUI and the `time` module.

### My Letter
Prints a short letter, creates a heading using a variable of 25 spaces to offset it.

### Random Color Rectangle
Generate different colored rectangles on canvas of random dimensions and placements using the `tkinter` GUI and `random` module.

### Shapes
Uses the `turtle` module to draw different polygons.

### Tkinter Polygons
Generate a pair of polygons using the `tkinter` GUI, defining their xy coordinates and angles in the args of `create_polygon()`.

### Tkinter Text
Uses the `tkinter` GUI to generate lines of text at specified coordinates, and with different fonts and font sizes if applicable.
