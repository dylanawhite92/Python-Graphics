# Python-Work

Documenting exercises I've done in Python. All text exercises meant to be run in the terminal using VS Code or any other preffered text editor, graphical code blocks ran in IDLE.

## How To Use
If downloading to a local repo, make sure that the latest version of Python is installed on your machine. See [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for one of many installation guides that can help you.

## Simple Code Blocks
Short blocks of code that accomplish singular goals for the purpose of learning different aspects of Python. These are all very elementary, but work is work and should be documented. Many of these are graphical programs that utilize Python's `tkinter` GUI toolkit, the `pygame` module, and the `turtle` module.
